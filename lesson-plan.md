# Lesson Plan

## Initial work
- Create index.html and write some boilerplate
- Open index.html in the browser and inspect it
  - Fix any mistakes/issues with the markup
- Get basic styles.css/main.js file loaded
  - Simple server

- Introduce parcel/bundler for hot reload

## Game basics
- Implement basic tic tac toe grid and style it
- Respond to button clicks on the cells
- Adding tic tac toe characters to cells
- Show a message on a draw (9 turns)
- Implement simple win condition
- Implement reset (or move to next section if state is really messy)

- Discuss state and common issues with complecting state/view logic
- Remove literals in favor of constants
- Separate view logic from state
- Refactor state to be functional where possible
- Implement reset button
- Make general improvement to the app

## Discussion Points
- Hot module reloading (HMR)
- Unit testing
- Typescript
